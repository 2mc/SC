SuperCollider Intro Outline

* What is SuperCollider?

- SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.
- SuperCollider consists of an interpreted object-oriented language which functions as a network client to a state of the art, realtime sound synthesis server.

* What can SuperCollider do?
** List of SuperCollider Capabilities
- Define Algorithms for interactive sound performance as well as for off-line composition
- Synthesize Sound Signals
- Process Sound Signals. Types of Signal Input: 
  - Live input
  - Imported sound buffers or live disk-in from files
  - Sounds generated internally in SuperCollider
- Communicate with other software and hardware for input and output
  - Via OSC: Processing, openFrameworks, PD, Quartz Composer ...
  - Via MIDI ...
  - Via Serial Port: Arduino and other serial hardware devices
  - Via HID: Game controllers
  - Wii
  - Tablet
- Synthesize animated graphics
  - Via embedded Quartz Composer
  - Directly with the Pen class
- Communicate over the Internet for networked performance

** Uses of SuperCollider
*** Live electronic music as sound source and/or effect machine
*** Composing music as sound structures, scores, or midi
*** Interactive installations with sensors
*** Internet art
*** Graphics synthesis
*** ... many other uses for wich an object oriented programming environment may be good

* How does SuperCollider work? 

** Client Server Architecture

*** Client: SuperCollider Language

*** Server: SuperCollider Sound Server

* Obtaining and Working with SuperCollider

** Home page, and download for MacOS, Windows, Linux
http://supercollider.sourceforge.net
** Mailing lists

** Additional, third party plugins (big library of extra sound processing algorithms)
http://sc3-plugins.sourceforge.net/

* History of SuperCollider
** 1989: James McCartney starts list objects on Max + Synth engine on Macintosh
** 1994: Pyrite: A programming language inside Max
** 1996: SuperCollider 1: Realtime sound synthesis on Mac PPC
** 1999: SuperCollider 2: SC becomes Object Oriented
** 2002: SuperCollider 3: Decoupled Client-Server applicaitons, Open Source
